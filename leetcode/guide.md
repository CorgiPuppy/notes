# Guide

## Common way

### Read and Understand the Problem (10 minutes)

Take your time to thoroughly understand the problem statement. Identify the input and output requirements, any constraints, and examples provided. Visualize sample inputs and outputs if it helps in understanding the problem better.

### Study LeetCode Solutions (10 minutes)

If you're unable to come up with a solution, jump to Solutions tab. Filter the solutions by language preference (e.g., Java) and read through them. Focus on understanding the logic and approach used in the top solution rather than just copying the code. Pay attention to any common patterns or techniques applied.

### Analyze Code and Explanation (10 minutes)

Go through the selected solution's code line by line. Understand the data structures used, any helper functions, and the overall algorithmic approach. If available, read the explanation provided by the author or community to gain deeper insights into the problem-solving process.

### Take a break

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem and its solution, take a break.

### Coding the Solution (20 minutes)

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem and its solution, it's time to code. Start by drafting the algorithm in pseudo-code or writing down key steps. Then, translate this into your preferred programming language. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks and tackle them one at a time.

### Test and Debug (As Needed)

After implementing the solution, test it with various inputs, including edge cases and corner cases. Debug any errors or unexpected behavior that may arise. Validate the correctness and efficiency of your solution by comparing it with the expected output.

## Starting on LeetCode

### Mastering DSA

Understanding DSA is key to solving problems on LeetCode. Start by mastering essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs. Pair this with learning fundamental algorithms such as sorting techniques, binary search, recursion, and graph traversal.

*Some keys areas to dive into*:

- working with arrays and strings;
- manipulating linked lists;
- traversing trees;
- exploring graph search methods.

### Choosing the Right Programming Language

Selecting a programming language is an important step. Python is a great choice for beginners because of its simple syntax and extensive libraries. However, your choice should depend on your familiarity with programming, the language's demand in the job market, and its built-in support for data structures.

*Factors to consider*:

- your prior coding experience;
- popularity of the language in tech roles;
- ease of implementing DSA.

### Navigating the LeetCode Platform

Once you've created an account, take advantage of the platform's tools like filters, Explore cards, and community forums. These features can help you streamline your learning process.

| Feature | Purpose |
