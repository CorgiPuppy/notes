# Guide

## Common way

### Read and Understand the Problem (10 minutes)

Take your time to thoroughly understand the problem statement. Identify the input and output requirements, any constraints, and examples provided. Visualize sample inputs and outputs if it helps in understanding the problem better.

### Study LeetCode Solutions (10 minutes)

If you're unable to come up with a solution, jump to Solutions tab. Filter the solutions by language preference (e.g., Java) and read through them. Focus on understanding the logic and approach used in the top solution rather than just copying the code. Pay attention to any common patterns or techniques applied.

### Analyze Code and Explanation (10 minutes)

Go through the selected solution's code line by line. Understand the data structures used, any helper functions, and the overall algorithmic approach. If available, read the explanation provided by the author or community to gain deeper insights into the problem-solving process.

### Take a break

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem and its solution, take a break.

### Coding the Solution (20 minutes)

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem and its solution, it's time to code. Start by drafting the algorithm in pseudo-code or writing down key steps. Then, translate this into your preferred programming language. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks and tackle them one at a time.

### Test and Debug (As Needed)

After implementing the solution, test it with various inputs, including edge cases and corner cases. Debug any errors or unexpected behavior that may arise. Validate the correctness and efficiency of your solution by comparing it with the expected output.

## Starting on LeetCode

### Mastering DSA

Understanding DSA is key to solving problems on LeetCode. Start by mastering essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs. Pair this with learning fundamental algorithms such as sorting techniques, binary search, recursion, and graph traversal.

*Some keys areas to dive into*:

- working with arrays and strings;
- manipulating linked lists;
- traversing trees;
- exploring graph search methods.

### Choosing the Right Programming Language

Selecting a programming language is an important step. Python is a great choice for beginners because of its simple syntax and extensive libraries. However, your choice should depend on your familiarity with programming, the language's demand in the job market, and its built-in support for data structures.

*Factors to consider*:

- your prior coding experience;
- popularity of the language in tech roles;
- ease of implementing DSA.

### Navigating the LeetCode Platform

Once you've created an account, take advantage of the platform's tools like filters, Explore cards, and community forums. These features can help you streamline your learning process.

| Feature | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| Problem Categories | Focus on specific topics to address weak areas |
| Difficulty Filters | Start with easier challenges and gradually level up |
| Discussion Forums | Gain insights from community solutions and tips |

*LeetCode Explore* cards are especially helpful, offering guided learning paths that combine theory with practical problems.

With these basics covered, you're ready to dive into solving problems and improving your skills step by step.

## Implroving Problem-Solving Skills

### Using a Structured Problem-Solving Method

The first step is to carefully analyze the problem statement. Break it into smaller parts and focus on the critical aspects:

| Step | What to Look For |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| Input Analysis | Data types, size limits, edge cases |
| Output Requirements | Expected format, validation rules |
| Constraints | Time/space complexity, special conditions |
| Test Cases | Typical inputs, edge cases, unexpected scenarios |

Sketching out your solution beforehand can help you spot potential problems and guide your implementation process.

### Practicing Key Coding Patters

Familiarize yourself with common coding patterns like *Sliding Window*, *Two Pointers*, and *Dynamic Programming*. These patterns are frequently used in interviews and can simplify a wide range of problems.

| Pattern | Where It Helps |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Sliding Window | String or array operations |
| Two Pointers | Array manipulation, linked lists |
| Dynamic Programming | Optimization problems |
| Greedy Algorithms | Scheduling, resource allocation |

### Progressing from Easy to Hard Problems

Start with easy problems to build a solid foundation, then gradually work your way up to medium and hard challenges. Use *LeetCode's Explore* cards or curated problem lists to practice systematically.

| Difficulty | Key Topics to Focus On |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Easy | Array manipulation, basic string operations |
| Medium | Tree traversal, graph algorithms |
| Hard | Advanced dynamic programming, complex optimizations |

If you get stuck, review solutions from others, but make sure to understand the logic behind them before moving forward. These strategies will help you consistently improve and build mastery on LeetCode.
